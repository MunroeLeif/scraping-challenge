# scraping-challenge
The purpose of this project was to strengthen data scraping skills by scraping both news articles about Mars as well as table data containing Martian weather data. 

# About
First, I scraped the Title and Preview text from the dummy Mars News website. I then saved the title-preview pairs in dictionaries in a master list. 
Secondly, I scraped the Mars temperature data from the dummy Mars facts website.  I then assembled the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame, for ease of analysis. Finally, I analyzed the temperature data in order to determine: a)the number of months on Mars, b)the number of Martian days worth of data is in the dataset, c)the coldest and warmest months on Mars, d)which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars, and e)how many terrestrial days exists in a Martian year.
